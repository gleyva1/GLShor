# # Shor's Algorithm (by Gerard Leyva)

# This is the Shor's algorithm for $N=63$. This script is based from the Qiskit tutorial with several changes.
# 
# https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/notebooks/ch-algorithms/shor.ipynb
# 
# The supported values of $a$ are $a=\{2,63\}$. This Jupyter notebook can is divided into five sections, listed in the end of this cell as a table of contents.
# 
# # Tutorial
# This script can be simply be ran in its entirety, which will execute section 5 (Execute Shor's Algorithm) and the circuit details provided in section 4 (Circuit Analysis). Note that section 5.c will run code that will run Shor's algorithm multiple times and save the results as ShorN63.csv.
# 
# The main portion that everybody will want to see (at first) is Shor's Algorithm finding a non-trivial factor of 63. To do this, make sure that section 3 section (Code Implementation Section) is executed in its entirety. Then run section 5.a (Find one factor, then stop).
# 
# Section 5.b will run the algorithm multiple times until it finds the two factors (9 and 7) of 63. It will also provide measurements of time based on the attempts it tries. Section 5.c does 5.c $S$ times, which is incredibly useful to get a sample set.

# ## 2. Circuit Design Section
# This section provides the basis for designing the c_amod() function, which is the funciton responsible for the modulus operation:
# 
# $$U|y\rangle = |ay\bmod 63\rangle $$
# 
# This c_amod() function performs what the $U$ matrix does to the wave function $|y\rangle$ that is fundamental in order to execute Shor's Algorithm for $N=63$. Because $63\in 2^n -1$ (that is, 111111 in binary is 63 in base-10) and is not a prime number, the periodicity of $U$ can be observed as a series of swaps:
# $$U|000001\rangle = |000010\rangle$$
# $$U|000010\rangle = |000100\rangle$$
# $$U|000100\rangle = |001000\rangle$$
# $$U|001000\rangle = |010000\rangle$$
# $$U|010000\rangle = |100000\rangle$$
# $$U|100000\rangle = |000001\rangle$$
# For this circuit, $a=2$ is fixed for the interests of our JHU course project schedules. The code below was used as a sandbox to 
# see if $|000001\rangle$ does indeed change to $|000010\rangle$ upon $U|000001\rangle$.

# ## 4. Circuit Analysis
# In this section, we create a circuit for the purposes of analyzing the circuit's circuit depth, the count of output registers and their corresponding phase measurements. This gives an idea as well as a picture and data of what is happening in this implementation of Shor's Algorithm.
# 
# ### 4.a: The Quantum Circuit Schematic
# Below, we prepare the circuit by placing all the input qubits in superpositions through Hadamard gates. Then, apply $U$ on each qubit, top to bottom.

# In[64]:


# Create QuantumCircuit with n_count

    qc.append(c_amodN(a, 2**q), 
             [q] + [i+n_count for i in range(ancilla_qubits)])

# Do inverse-QFT

# ### 4.b: Measure the circuit depth details
# This section provides the number of $U$ orperations, the number of operations of the decomposed gates (including the inverse-QFT gate), and a circuit diagram of the decomposed gates.

# a. Find one factor, then stop (non-trivial, of course)
# 
# b. Find both factors, 9 and 7. That is, completely factor 63 such that 63 = 7 Ã— 9. This will show various time measurements.
